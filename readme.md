## Overview
Simple base for creating Wordpress themes, based on HTML5 BOILERPLATE 4.3.0 (http://html5boilerplate.com/)  
Uses LESS (http://lesscss.org/) as CSS pre-processor and relies on wp-less plugin (https://github.com/oncletom/wp-less)

## Usage
1. Copy these files to `wp-content/themes/your-theme` (and remove this readme)
2. Install & activate wp-less (https://github.com/oncletom/wp-less)
3. Install & activate wp-jshrink (https://github.com/miletsky/wp-jshrink). Absolutely not obligatory, but makes sense if you're gonna have a lot of js
4. ...
5. Profit, start implementing your functionality!
6. Don't forget to create actual screenshot.png

## Structure
1. `assets/less/style.less` - the main theme style, includes all css components and modules via @import. 
Made so to serve all styles in a single minified file. This file is enqueued in `functions/enqueue.php` and then handled by wp-less.
2. `assets/less/components` - put here your styles and then import in style.less, or use existing structure
3. `assets/js` - your javascript goes here
4. `functions/` - everything from this folder is reqired_once in functions.php, made so to break functions into smaller files
5. `style.css` - here you put your theme details (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Stylesheet)
6. Enqueue your styles and scripts in `functions/enqueue.php`
